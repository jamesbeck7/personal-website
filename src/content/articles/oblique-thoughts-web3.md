1. Whenever you're creating a piece of content, stop and ask: If I didn't work here, would I watch or read this?

2. The Seventh Generation principle: Great Law of the Iroquois which holds appropriate to think seven generations ahead and decide whether the decisions they make today would benefit their descendants. How will the things we build today benefit people seven generations from now?

3. Your blog is not a publication.

4. Spend time in kitchens, gardens, and libraries.

5. Phenology is the study of the relationship between the changes that come with the seasons. What has changed between DeFi summer and the third crypto winter?

6. If you are feeling creatively stuck, try flipping through Brian Eno's Oblique Strategies — "Each card contains a gnomic suggestion, aphorism or remark which can be used to break a deadlock or dilemma situation."

7. Every marketing employee needs to be the voice of the customer. When was the last time you submitted a ticket or submitted a PR for MetaMask?

8. Test dapps. Founders in web3 need more feedback loops with their users. Let's drink our own champagne.

9. Find common ground with people and ideologies you disagree with, instead of categorically rejecting them.

10. Honor your error as a hidden intention.

11. Olga Tokarczuk – Nobel Lecture: "How we think about the world and—perhaps even more importantly—how we narrate it have a massive significance, therefore. A thing that happens and is not told ceases to exist and perishes."

12. At ConsenSys we get to ask ourselves every day: what is money? Money is never independent of social and political relations, or of culture. It is based on trust and social values.

13. Gardening not Architecture.

14. If you want to understand the vision of web3, read Steven Johnson's Beyond the Bitcoin Bubble (2018).

15. Finance commodifies. One unique thing can be assigned the same worth as another.

16. Ask your body.

17. Baudrillard's Simulacra & Simulation: Are NFTs pure simulacrum?

18. Work at a different speed.

19. How can we appeal to the phenomenology of Ethereum and the people we market our products to?

20. Read about Bowie bonds and how if he lived today he might have used royalty streams to collateralize tokens instead of paper bonds.

21. Judith Butler: "There is no 'I' that can stand apart from the social conditions of its emergence."

22. Criticism is love. How has Web3 fallen short of its promises?

23. Be very suspicious of adjectives and adverbs. Strong writing is about verb choice.

24. Listen to David Ogilvy: "On the average, five times as many people read the headline as read the body copy."

25. Think about nexus — the connection between your last paragraph and the proceeding.

26. Compare A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace with A Declaration of the Interdependence of Cyberspace.

27. McKenzie Wark: "As with any other financial instrument in a portfolio, the artwork in a collection gains and loses value at the volatile edge between information and noise."

28. Simon Denny: "The crypto space is often accused by people from the art world of being commodified and hyper-flipped. But blockchain has made transparent what has always already been at play."

29. Haruki Murakami: "Whether in music or in fiction, the most basic thing is rhythm."

30. Practice reciprocity in all things. A gift requires a gift.
