Welcome to my blog! I'm James Beck, and this is my little corner of the internet.

## What to expect

I'll be writing about various topics that interest me, including:

- **Technology** - Software development, tools, and trends
- **Learning** - Things I'm exploring and lessons learned
- **Projects** - Side projects and experiments

## Why start a blog?

Writing helps me think more clearly and document my journey. If something I write helps someone else along the way, that's a bonus.

## Let's connect

Feel free to reach out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jamesbeck) or [GitHub](https://github.com/jamesjohnbeck-dotcom). I'd love to hear from you!

Thanks for stopping by.
